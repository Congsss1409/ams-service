## üìñ About The Project

This repository contains the central **Accreditation Management System (AMS)** for the School Management System III capstone project. Developed as a stand-alone microservice, its primary role is to act as the "brain" of the entire system, capable of integrating with other operational modules to provide a centralized hub for accreditation document management, compliance tracking, and high-level analytics.

This project was built by 4th-year IT students to solve the real-world challenge of preparing for school accreditation, based on the processes of Bestlink College of the Philippines.

## üó∫Ô∏è System Architecture

Our School Management System is built on a microservices architecture. This `ams-service` acts as the central accreditation and reporting hub, designed to communicate with other modules (like Faculty Management, SIS, etc.) via a robust API. This separation of concerns allows for modular development and scalability.
