## üìñ About The Project

This repository contains the central **Accreditation Management System (AMS)** and **Executive Information System (EIS)** for the School Management System III capstone project. Developed as a stand-alone microservice, its primary role is to act as the "brain" of the entire system, gathering data from nine other operational modules to provide a centralized hub for accreditation document management, compliance tracking, and high-level analytics for school leadership.

This project was built by 4th-year IT students to solve the real-world challenge of preparing for school accreditation, based on the processes of Bestlink College of the Philippines.
