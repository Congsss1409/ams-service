# School Management System III - Accreditation Management System

As a team of 4th-year IT students, we developed this comprehensive, web-based School Management System to modernize and streamline the core operations of an educational institution. Our primary focus was to tackle the complex process of accreditation, and we've built-in a PREDICTIVE GAP COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS feature to provide real, actionable insights for school leadership.

## üìñ About Our Project

In this repository, you'll find the central **Accreditation Management System (AMS)** that we created for our capstone project, the School Management System III. We designed it as a stand-alone microservice to act as the "brain" of the entire system. It's capable of integrating with nine other operational modules, providing a centralized hub for managing accreditation documents, tracking compliance, and performing high-level analytics.

We built this project to solve the real-world challenges of preparing for school accreditation, basing our work on the actual processes of Bestlink College of the Philippines.

### ‚ú® What We've Built (Features)

Our system is feature-complete with all the core modules we planned for accreditation management:

* **Secure Authentication & User Management:** We implemented a complete login system using Laravel Sanctum, along with a full CRUD interface for administrators to manage user accounts.
* **Dynamic Dashboard & Predictive Gap Analysis:** We created an interactive dashboard that gives a high-level overview of the compliance status for all academic programs, predicting which are "On Track," "Need Attention," or are "At Risk."
* **Program Management:** We built a full CRUD interface to manage academic programs and their current accreditation levels.
* **Centralized Document Repository:** Our system allows for uploading, viewing, and managing accreditation documents, all organized by program and the 9 required accreditation sections.
* **Compliance Matrix:** We developed a dynamic matrix that tracks the completion status of required documents against the predefined accreditation criteria for any selected program.
* **Modern UI/UX:** We designed a professional and responsive user interface with React and Bootstrap, which includes a collapsible sidebar and interactive alerts using SweetAlert2.

## üó∫Ô∏è Our System Architecture

We designed our School Management System using a microservices architecture. This `ams-service` acts as the central hub for accreditation and reporting. We built it to communicate with other modules (like Faculty Management, SIS, etc.) through a robust API, a design choice that allows for modular development and makes the whole system easier to scale.
